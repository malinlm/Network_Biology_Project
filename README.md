# Network_Biology_Project

## Research question
What are the similarities and differences in protein interactions between humans and HIV-1 and HIV-2?

## Cytoscape session (Project_Human_HIV)
Cytoscape (version 3.10.1) Contains the STRING networks used as a foundation to generate figures and functional enrichment analysis. HIV-1 and HIV-2 networks, merged_network, and the pair networks are of higher importance. 

## Project_clustering.R
Contains R-code to run ClusterProfiler (version 4.6.2) which made the networks named "cluster" in the cytoscape session.
